title: Fragments of Iceland
excerpt: Good cables are a luxury, and I like the stuff from Native Union. They use
  really nice materials including fabric, have a variety of lengths and applications,
  and are also experimenting with form factors including this cone cable that even
  I couldn’t manage to lose. I also really like the international travel chargers,
  allow 4 devices to be plugged into that hotel room that strangely only has one outlet.

Good cables are a luxury, and I like the stuff from Native Union. They use really nice materials including fabric, have a variety of lengths and applications, and are also experimenting with form factors including this [cone cable](https://www.nativeunion.com/cone-cable/) that even I couldn’t manage to lose. I also really like the [international travel chargers](https://www.nativeunion.com/smart-4-charger-international/), allow 4 devices to be plugged into that hotel room that strangely only has one outlet.
