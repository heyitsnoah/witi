description: This is part of the argument that Betty Friedan made in her landmark
  book _The Feminine Mystique_ in 1963. She studied women who worked as housewives
  (here Iâ€™m being deliberate about separating gender from work identity) in comparison
  to women who worked in professional spheres, and found that women who worked outside
  the home completed the same amount of home tasks in less time than those who worked
  in the home.
