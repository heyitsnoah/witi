description: "[_Joanne McNeil_](https://twitter.com/jomc) _(JOMC)_ [_originally wrote
  today’s email for her excellent newsletter All My Stars_](https://jomc.substack.com/p/cayce-and-case)_.
  We liked it so much that we asked if she would mind us running it here. Joanne’s
  got a fascinating-sounding book coming out next year called Lurking: How a Person
  Became a User. From the promotional site: “she charts what it is that brought people
  online and what keeps us here even as the social equations of digital life—what
  we’re made to trade, knowingly or otherwise, for the benefits of the internet—have
  shifted radically beneath us.” You can (and should) pre-order at Amazon._"
