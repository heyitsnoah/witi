description: 'If you’re in a bind and need to get one last present, may I suggest
  Kevin Wilson’s new novel _Nothing to See Here_? I put it on hold at the library
  after reading what must be one of the effusive first paragraphs of a book review
  that exists. Here’s how Taffy Brodesser-Akner [opened her review](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/books/review/nothing-to-see-here-kevin-wilson.html):
  “Good Lord, I can’t believe how good this book is. I know you’re supposed to begin
  book reviews with subtlety and a nod to storytelling’s past and the long literary
  tradition that the book has managed to hook itself onto. But ‘Nothing to See Here,’
  the third novel by Kevin Wilson (‘The Family Fang’), defies an entry like that because
  it’s wholly original. It’s also perfect.” I ripped through the novel about two kids
  who self-combust in just a few days and it was as delightful as the review suggested.'
