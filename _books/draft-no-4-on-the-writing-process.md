description: I was recently reminded of [this excellent New York Times Magazine profile
  of the writer John McPhee](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/magazine/the-mind-of-john-mcphee.html).
  McPhee, as I’m sure some of you are aware, is a journalist and writing professor
  at Princeton who is considered one of the leading voices of literary/creative nonfiction.
  He’s written books that range from the [retelling of a single 1968 tennis match](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374515263/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=noahbrierdotc-20&linkId=b27902243f50df4a2c3167f1e8702c36),
  to [a book-length profile of Bill Bradley’s time at Princeton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374526893/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i9),
  to [the story of a conservationist and his three enemies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LVP9KO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=noahbrierdotc-20&linkId=8fb6a1bd82b4dfb445335fe33ed81070).
  In 2017 he came out with a book called _Draft No. 4_ which outlined his writing
  process, including his unique approach to outlining his stories.
