description: 'While in South America, I read Andrea Wulfâ€™s wonderful book on 19th-century
  scientist Alexander Von Humboldt, _The Invention of Nature_. Aside from being a
  joy to read, it came up constantly in conversation with people I met: Streets, parks,
  oceanic currents, plants, and animals throughout the continent bore his name.'
