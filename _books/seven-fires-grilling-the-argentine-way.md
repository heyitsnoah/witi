description: I’ve been on a big Francis Mallmann kick lately. He’s an Argentine chef
  that has become the master of grilling over open flames. Plus, he lives on a small
  island on a remote lake in Patagonia and lives a pretty interesting life. Worth
  picking up his book, _Seven Fires_, here, and also reading the [Best Made article
  about him](https://www.bestmadeco.com/our-adventures/new-node) with an incredible
  slide show as a bonus.
