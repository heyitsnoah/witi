description: I wrote about the book, _Say Nothing_, in [WITI earlier this year](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/why-is-this-interesting-friday-march-b29),
  but wanted to formally recommend it to people who have recently started reading
  the newsletter. [Patrick Radden Keefe](https://www.patrickraddenkeefe.com/) is a
  masterful researcher and brings new facts that illustrate the Troubles in Northern
  Ireland. His reporting was assisted by a very secret series of documents held under
  lock and key at Boston College as part of an oral history they began developing
  in the early 2000s. In addition, he got people to talk that had kept their lips
  sealed for a long time. As the book title suggests, these were people that would
  normally say nothing. One of the [best reads of the year for me](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Nothing-Murder-Northern-Ireland/dp/0385521316).
