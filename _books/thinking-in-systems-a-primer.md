description: As [Donella Meadows](http://donellameadows.org/), who literally wrote
  the book on systems thinking, explains, “Once we see the relationship between structure
  and behavior, we can begin to understand how systems work, what makes them produce
  poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns.” It is a way
  of thinking that gives us the freedom to identify root causes of problems and see
  new opportunities.”
