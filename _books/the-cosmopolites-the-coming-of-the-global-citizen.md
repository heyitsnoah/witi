description: 'Since my book came out, my interest in buying and selling citizenship
  has informed my new obsession: borders. I’m fascinated by where they are, what they
  look like, who they let in and keep out. Most of all, I think about the ways in
  which all of this reflects [bigger political ideas about statehood, citizenship,
  and sovereignty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/border-wall-immigration-trump.html).
  That’s how I encountered Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago where anyone, theoretically,
  can live without a visa.'
