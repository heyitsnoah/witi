description: An aside in [this 2018 story about tasmanian devils dying of contagious
  cancer](https://www.popsci.com/cancer-tasmanian-devils-chemotherapy/) made me Google
  [HeLa cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa), the most commonly used cell line
  in scientific research. The search led me to Rebecca Skloot’s book _The Immortal
  Life of Henrietta Lacks_, which I finished over the Christmas break. It’s an amazing
  dive into both the controversial history of an important tool in medicine and Lacks’
  family, who are still dealing with the consequences of the spread of Henrietta’s
  cells around the world without her permission.
