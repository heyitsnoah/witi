description: Nearly every year-end best books list included Tara Westover’s Educated,
  a memoir about growing up in an ultra-religious Mormon household that was completely
  disconnected from the outside world. She eventually escaped, both physically and
  mentally, when she went to Brigham Young University (and eventually Cambridge and
  Harvard). Westover was named to the Time 100 (with a write up from Bill Gates),
  is giving this year’s commencement address at Northeastern University, and has gotten
  shout outs from both Barack and Michelle Obama in the last twelve months. (NRB 4/24)
