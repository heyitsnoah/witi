description: Nearly every year-end best books list included Tara Westover’s *Educated*,
  a memoir about growing up in an ultra-religious Mormon household that was completely
  disconnected from the outside world. She eventually escaped, both physically and
  mentally, when she went to Brigham Young University (and eventually Cambridge and
  Harvard). Westover was named to the <a href="http://time.com/5568769/how-we-chose-time-100-2019/">Time
