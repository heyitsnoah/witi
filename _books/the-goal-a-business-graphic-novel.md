description: 'In the end, all this stuff comes down to finding bottlenecks: The parts
  of the process that limit the speed of everything that happens after it. The best
  book I know of on bottlenecks is the cheesy but excellent _The Goal_ by Eliyahu
  Goldratt (also available—and recommended—in graphic novel form). The book revolves
  around Goldratt’s “[theory of constraints](https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints.html)”
  and the five focusing steps to uncover bottlenecks, which I’ve found to be a helpful
  framework to apply to almost any process'
