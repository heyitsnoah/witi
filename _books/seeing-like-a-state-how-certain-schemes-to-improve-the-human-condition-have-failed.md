description: If I told you one of the best books I’ve read in years begins with an
  extended discussion of 18th century European forestry, you would be forgiven for
  thinking that didn’t sound like a very promising endorsement. I felt the same way
  when a friend recommended James C. Scott’s _Seeing Like A State_ to me, but I’m
  glad I stuck with it because I now consider the book a personal touchstone.
