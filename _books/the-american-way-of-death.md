description: I’ve been interested in end-of-life practices and choices since reading
  Jessica Mitford’s _The American Way of Death_ back in my 20s. The book, initially
  published in 1963, has aged remarkably well with its evergreen hot take that the
  American funeral industry has perfected the art of turning grief into high-margin
  profits. And like many of you at some point, I have been faced with hard decisions
  delivered via hard sell in a funeral home, where dollars spent are communicated
  as a proxy for one last opportunity to signal affection, and to elevate the performative
  component of one’s grieving.
