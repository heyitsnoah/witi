description: Per today’s topic, I highly recommend reading some Marshall McLuhan.
  His ideas about media, and its relationship with messages, has shaped the way I
  think about the world, particularly when it comes to platforms and their content.
  He can also be a little tough to get started with, so I suggest getting going with
  _The Medium is the Massage_, a picture book version of his theories. It’s great.
