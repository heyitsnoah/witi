description: 'While I’m far away from an expert, my favorite book of the genre, and
  one of my very favorite of the year was _Beyond Weird: Why Everything You Thought
  You Knew about Quantum Physics Is Different_ by Philip Ball. The core idea of the
  book is that on one hand quantum physics is less hard to understand than many would
  have you believe, but on the other the challenges in comprehension mostly lay in
  the fact that our language was developed in a Newtonian world. If you’re not quite
  ready to jump in, start with [Ball’s talk at the Royal Institution on the same topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7v5NtV8v6I).'
