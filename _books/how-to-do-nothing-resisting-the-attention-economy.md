description: "[Jenny Odell](https://twitter.com/the_jennitaur)’s new book, _How To
  Do Nothing,_ has been a huge influence on me lately, especially affecting the way
  I see the world. I’ve been thinking about moving slower, being deliberate about
  my positionality, and keeping some stories—and experiences—offline."
