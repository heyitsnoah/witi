Why is this interesting? is a daily email started in March of 2019 by [Noah Brier](https://twitter.com/heyitsnoah) & [Colin Nagy](https://twitter.com/cjn). It's a chance to explore topics and ideas without being wed to the ["news peg"](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/why-is-this-interesting-thursday-f1d). In an effort to keep up the momentum (a newsletter a day can be exhausting), [guest editions](/contributors) started about a month after launch. If you want to try your hand at contributing, [please get in touch](/contact).
