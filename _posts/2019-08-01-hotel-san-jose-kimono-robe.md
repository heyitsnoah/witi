title: Hotel San Jose Kimono Robe
excerpt: 'Liz Lambert is one of our favorite hoteliers. She’s responsible for the
  wonderful Hotel San Jose in Austin, among many others. With all of her properties
  there’s a bit of soul and whimsy, appealing to the wonder of being out of the house
  and normal routines for a few days. The best parts of a hotel stay. This is perhaps
  best personified by this robe. In their words: “Custom made, super soft, 100% cotton
  kimono robe in serape pattern with green and red as the prominent colors. Made in
  a government sponsored co-op in India, promoting indigenous weaving and dyeing techniques.”
  Plus if you own one, it breaks up the drudgery the typical morning routine, making
  one feel like a psychedelic mind warrior while retrieving the FT Weekend from the
  doorstep. Or, if you are staying at the property, a daring and self assured walk
  to retrieve delicious breakfast tacos and a coffee from Jo’s next door. (CJN)'
