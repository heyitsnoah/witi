title: Eau d'Orange Verte by Hermes
excerpt: 'Though there are more nuanced and complicated scents, the Hermes classic
  Eau d’orange Verte always brightens my day a little bit in whatever form: soap,
  fragrance, etc.. If I had to pick something and stick to it (which is a hard task!)
  this would be on the very shortlist. Also, fragrance descriptions are amazing. Here’s
  the writeup from the brand: “The founding cologne, created by Françoise Caron in
  1979 and inspired by the smell of undergrowth moist with morning dew, Eau d’orange
  verte has since asserted itself as an emblem of HERMÈS, standing out by its distinctive
  freshness. Conceived as an explosion of citrus notes, orange plays the principal
  role supported by zest and leaves, lemon, mandarin, mint, and blackcurrant bud.
  The fragrance reveals its complexity in a unique sillage composed of oak moss and
  patchouli.” (CJN)'
