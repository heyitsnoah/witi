title: Hario Glass Cold Brew Coffee Bottle
excerpt: Speaking of coffee, I’m a year-round iced coffee drinker. I just prefer cold
  coffee to the hot stuff. Over the years, I’ve tried various methods for making my
  cold coffee (Aeropress on ice, vats of cold brew, buying bottles of Grady’s). For
  Christmas, I got a Hario Cold Brew Bottle. It’s got a fine filter that drops right
  into the bottle, and the whole thing is dishwasher safe. I just bought a second
  so I can easily rotate. It’s the easiest setup/cleanup cold brew method I’ve found.
