title: unknownvariable Palo Santo Cones
excerpt: 'I love the fragrant wood Palo Santo, which originated in the Andes and is
  often used as a remedy for purifying and cleansing a space. But the sticks themselves
  can be a bit annoying and finicky to keep lit. Friend, bon vivant, and WITI reader
  Raihan sells these palo santo cones that burn slowly and evenly to create a nice
  mood. In his words: “The wood that can''t be sold as sticks are put through a slow
  chipper (that still preserves those lovely essential oils) and turned into these
  cones, with the addition of some bamboo-based binder. They are about the size of
  your thumb and one cone is good for multiple burn sessions.” (CJN) '
